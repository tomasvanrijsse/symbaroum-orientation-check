  { title: "1. The Campsite",description: "The characters find an abandoned campsite. Is it truly abandoned? Is there any valuable equipment left behind, or something dangerous?"},
  { title: "2. The Corpse",description: "The characters come across the remains of a dead fortune-hunter who was not prepared for the challenges of Davokar. What killed this person? Do the characters recognize the deceased?"},
  { title: "3. A Distant Howl",description: "An inhuman howl is heard way out in the woods; soon thereafter it is heard again, closer this time. How do the members of the expedition react? "},
  { title: "4. A Bad Omen",description: "The characters encounter signs indicating a clear and present danger. What kind of signs – footprints, cadavers, mucus, blood? And how fresh are they?"},
  { title: "5. Sudden Silence",description: "Suddenly the forest holds its breath and a tense silence falls over the expedition. Why?"},
  { title: "6. Stuck",description: "One of the expedition’s carts or part of their equipment gets stuck, in mud, in a crack or under a falling giant tree. It takes two people, each of them succeeding at a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check, to remedy the situation. If one of the checks fails, the company will travel 5 miles (ten kilometers) shorter this day; if both checks fail, it takes a whole day before they can continue forth."},
  { title: "7. Shadowed",description: "The expedition is being followed, which can be noticed by a character with a passive Perception of 15 or higher. Who is spying on them, and with what intent?"},
  { title: "8. Thorns",description: "The expedition stops at the edge of a vast field of dense thorn bushes. They can go around, thereby cutting the day’s traveling distance in half. If they try to force their way through, all members must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 piercing damage on a failure."},
  { title: "9. The Patrol",description: "A unit from the Queen’s Rangers orders the expedition to halt. They rummage through packs and other bags and demand to see the group’s Explorer’s License. Are they really rangers of the Queen? If yes, are they corrupt? "},
  { title: "10. Mosquito swarm",description: "During the day’s walk, the characters are harassed by a swarm of mosquitoes. What they don’t know is that the insects are exposing them to a disease. See rules on diseases in the core rules and roll 1d6: 1–3 Cackle Fever; 4–5 Sewer Plague; 6 Sight Rot."},
  { title: "11. Downpour",description: "A strange, icy rain hammers down on the forest and the expedition is soaked. The characters must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the person catches a chill and has disadvantage on ability checks until they spend a short or longer rest getting warm by sitting close to a fire."},
  { title: "12. Lost",description: "The characters have to admit that they have lost their bearings. As usual, the guide rolls one Orientation check per day, but with disadvantage. If failed, the group wanders in circles and makes no progress at all; if successful, they progress at normal speed. It takes three successful checks with disadvantage before they escape the bewildering area and hence are free from the disadvantage. What makes the terrain so difficult to navigate?"},
  { title: "13. Sick Animals",description: "The animals of the expedition seem exhausted and throw up all they eat. A character can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check – one check per day and animal to relieve their symptoms. If the company travels with one or more sick animals, they only move a quarter of the normal distance. Maybe they have to leave some animals behind? "},
  { title: "14. Marshland",description: "Suddenly, the characters reach a vast marshland which will take half a day to circumvent. If they choose to proceed, the guide must make a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check. If failed, a random expedition member starts to sink and the others must make two DC 13 Strength (Athletics) checks to save them. If three checks fail before two successes are rolled, the unlucky one disappears into the muck."},
  { title: "15. Ambush",description: "Hostiles in the area are planning to ambush the characters, which may be noted with either passive Perception of 20 or higher or by making a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check with disadvantage. Who is the enemy and what is its goal? "},
  { title: "16. Spoiling Food",description: "The characters discover that something has consumed some of their supplies while they were sleeping or traveling, or the provisions are attacked by aggressive microbes which cause part of the stock to rot. The expedition loses 2d10 rations. "},
  { title: "17. Wildfire",description: "Without warning, a wildfire spreads toward the expedition at an alarming rate. Each person must pass two DC 10 Dexterity saving throws to reach a safe location. Anyone who fails one or more throws takes 1d4 fire damage for 1d4 turns before getting to safety; note that they cannot stop and try to extinguish the flames before then. What happens to the pack animals and/or the contracted carriers?"},
  { title: "18. From Bad to Worse",description: "Roll two times on this table and use both outcomes."},
  { title: "19. Discord in the Ranks",description: "The strenuous journey is starting to get on peoples’ nerves. Two non-player characters in the expedition start fighting violently. What has happened? Is one of them infected by something?"},
  { title: "20. Sacred Ground",description: "The ground that the characters are traversing is considered taboo for strangers by the local population – the trespassers must die! Who lives in the area? Why the taboo?"},
  { title: '21. Corrupted Soil', description: "The environment suddenly feels twisted and sick; soon it can be seen, on the dark veins and black leaves of the vegetation. The area is blight-stricken; the characters can turn back and choose another way (loses one day), or they can proceed, in which case each character must succeed at a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1d6 points of temporary Corruption that do not leave the body until they have left the corrupted area behind."},
  { title: '22. Hangman’s Hill', description: "Without warning you see them hanging there, in nooses from the lower branches, gutted and mutilated: the members of a large expedition. A DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) check is required to convince the characters’ companions not to turn around and leave. Who has done this, and why? "},
  { title: '23. Sabotage', description: "During the night, a lone saboteur tries to access the expedition’s members, provisions and/or animals. Who is the saboteur? What is the target? Can the player characters thwart the attempt? "},
  { title: '24. The Ironsworn’s Ultimatum ', description: "They appear as if from out of the very air, along the path where the characters are walking – an Iron Pact warband, arrows pointing at the travelers. The leader of the elves gives an ultimatum: turn around and take a long detour (two days) or face the Ironsworn’s wrath. Why? Can an agreement be reached, such as being blindfolded and escorted through the area?"},
  { title: '25. Lair of Evil', description: "Something in this region attracts aggressive monsters and adversaries – roll on the Enemies in Davokar table (page 71). What is attracting these creatures to the area?"},
  { title: '26. Delirium', description: "The characters start hearing and seeing what isn’t there; horrifying figures connected to their own history. If a character openly questions what they see and hear, they can make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw; success means that the hallucinations subside. The Gamemaster decides how much time passes before the group can resume the journey. Is the delirium caused by something they have eaten, or bysomething in the air or water?"},
  { title: '27. The Eternal Contagion', description: "Everything in the area is dead or twisted beyond recognition. This place is horribly corrupt; even if the characters decide to turn back and go around (losing one day), they must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or suffer one point of permanent Corruption. If they choose to proceed and fail the Charisma saving throw, they suffer 2 points of permanent Corruption; should the saving throw succeed, they are instead plagued by 1d6 temporary Corruption. In both cases, all provisions are automatically infected – each ration consumed deals one point of temporary corruption that does not go away until the afflicted has eaten pure food for a week."},
  { title: '28. Disappearance', description: "An expedition member (character, companion or animal with supplies) suddenly disappears, as if evaporated into nothing. Were they transferred to another place, time or world? Who or what caused the disappearance, and why?"},
  { title: '29. Heart of Darkness', description: "A member of the expedition encounters something that makes him or her crazy (bug bite, spores, foul air or similar). Select a non-player or player character at random, who then must roll a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. The character suffers 2 permanent Corruption if the save is successful, or , findsRollCount:1 , findsDice:4 , findsBaseValue: 1 if it fails. Irrespective of which, the victim will attack the closest person with the intent of killing him or her – a state that remains for the duration of the scene. "},
  { title: '30. The Eye of the Forest', description: "All who travel the area feel as if they are being watched by the forest itself, as if it is assessing them, searching for weaknesses. Suddenly the feeling grows many times stronger, becomes threatening, like the whole world is out to get them. Each character must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage. On a failure, they are struck by panic and start fleeing in different directions. The panic persists for 1d4 hours, and during that time the expedition members become scattered, alone in the depths of Davokar…"},
